Professor abhi, what little I see.

His door pass still lost,
but at seemingly no cost.

I wonder how much more it'll take
or if it's all just fake.

A cryptic disguise fills my eyes,
no surprise, no lies.

He wears a scarf around his neck,
to maximal effect.

Professor Abhi Shelat, I don't quite know yet.
