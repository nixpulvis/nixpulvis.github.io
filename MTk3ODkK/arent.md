The strong ones aren't we

For a song played naught
For the behest lest fought
We wallow alone

The strong ones aren't we

For the hypocrite entices
And a weak horde rejoices
Fury lightning

The strong ones aren't we

Raveled and raveled
Spring giving sprung
Cannot be undone

The strong ones aren't we
