This world it seems -- is bursting at the seams.
Chock full and hardly half-cocked.
Layers and layers of delicious slop.
When one doesn't work, don't drop it. Block!

Backed up against a wall,
Teetering on the very edge of it all.

Run the fuck away.
Don't give in.
Just play.

Burst free from the trend
then you will mend
that which was meant
never to be so bent
twisted and used
fervently abused

Burst free
