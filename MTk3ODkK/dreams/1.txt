I had a dream last night, that I was a camp counselor.

Me and a friend were working at the camp's snack shop, flirting and having a jolly ol time.
We'd make a mess, and clean it up, while the management wasn't looking.
One of the other counselors was always using the off time to clean his gun on the carpet in the front.

One day, however I noticed my friend stealing a few bucks from the register. I was clear that this wasn't right, but I didn't do anything about it.
The next day, all three of us awoke in a beige 90s style brick office room. There was a desk in the middle separating us from 2 burley, angry looking men.
I assumed they were Russian.
I don't recall a single word they said, but we knew we had to get the fuck out of there.
Somehow I had possession of the other consoler's gun, which only made me more nervous.

At the first chance we all three broke out running,
First out of the room.
Then through the maze of hallways, which I somehow already knew.
I'd been here before.

Only two of us made it to the EXIT.

Then I woke up.
