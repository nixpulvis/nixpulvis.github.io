I ride on the slow quad, taken in a moment of confusion. All alone.

While I find myself staring at an old acquaintance pass me by on a high speed single. What a concept. While I am left feeling too free, loose and vertiginous. No safety bar in sight. She is strapped in as if riding on a roller coaster.

She zooms past me, making me wonder about the nature of my haste. Just long enough to distract me from my fears. The feeling races back to me however, somehow feeling worse knowing I'm even more alone on these lines than I had at first thought.
