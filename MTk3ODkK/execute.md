Awake to a stream of green blood, flowing and flowing, orthonormal characters fading as they drip down the screen. Columns like veins, each perfectly aligned upon the screen.

The screen is body, beneath the keyboard is mind; with eyes in the back of it's head. Like a green fueled alien, foreign to only those who haven't been watching; using.

You imagine the sound of gears beginning to turn as you execute a command. The flow of green blood remains calm, yet the alien machine itself roars to life.

There's a finality to each execution. You cannot take it back now, for the machine has a mind of it's own.

You whisper 'kill 1' and in agony, the flow of blood stops, the light goes out, and all signs of life cease suddenly. The penultimate execution is complete.
