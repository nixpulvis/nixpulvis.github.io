We enter the stairs from a door in the back.
It's clearly another adventure, but where does this lead?
Nails protrude from the railings. Rats scurry away underfoot.
A single incandescent light four floors up fills the
    vertical tunnel with a hint of light.
Each step is taken carefully, as the steps are each different.
I lead the way to the top, but not for long. People are running
    up and down.
Those of us who remain open the door to the roof.
And in that moment the world was right.
Rain pouring down onto the city, each building taller than the next.
Forming steps into the night sky.
Colors collect in the puddles.
The air tastes fresh, while smelling like the city.
We soak it all in.
