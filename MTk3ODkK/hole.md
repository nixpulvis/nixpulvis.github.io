I'm holed up but not whole.

My walls, nearly nothing they hold.
My bookshelves, merely the same.
The boxes filled with books,
remain untouched for days.

I expose myself, bare and alone.
For little do I know, of who reads my woes.
So in a moment of careless progress,
I open this tome.


Filled with dusty old words and emotions all to familiar. I can taste the disgrace to leave them as they are. But saves them the betrayal of becoming what I became.


In this way, I save happiness for another day. For a time when I won't shut it out. For a time when I can see the past with level eyes.

For a time when I'm whole.
