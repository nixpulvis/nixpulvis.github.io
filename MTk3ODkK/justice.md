The day will come again when I am labeled by some new form of
mindful algorithm and I must argue that label's validity and
meaning.

The conversation will end like this:

Me:    Your algorithm needs work.
Them:  No, it's fine. *You* need work.

The act of debate will have been offloaded to a set of trained
conditions and conditioners, which I will have failed or will
still be failing. Neither of us will learn anything new. The
conclusion will depend only on the severity of the label and
the power split between us. Exactly as expected.

Truth and justice will be lost in the process as I succumb to
the gross new label of rot.
