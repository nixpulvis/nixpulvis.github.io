I am a provokatuer
because it's the only cure

As we squirm and fight
someone out there, I'm sure
can see what is right

Love or hate
there is still only one gate

Project your worst
too late
you aren't even the first

We are small
trying to be tall

Preach to a preacher
you won't get any sleep at all
