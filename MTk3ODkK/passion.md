Passion is a fuel, consumed by fate. It can spread like fire or
smolder in place. It's destructive and constructive, no stranger
to pain. Find it, protect it, and let it grow. Only then will you
know.

Passion strikes, and harmony responds. Like a silent arrow in the
midsts of war. Resolved and pure. They cool, yet refuse to be
fooled. And if we're careful, we let them rest, only to awaken
upon the master's request.

Don't confuse the sensation with malice or fear. Passion is a
sense we all hold very dear. Quick, automatic, driven, the
original action. A force of nature, with no faction.
