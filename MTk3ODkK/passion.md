Passion is a fuel, consumed by fate. It can spread like fire or smolder in
place. It's destructive and constructive, no stranger to pain.

Find it, protect it, and let it grow.

Passion strikes, and harmony responds. Like a silent arrow in the midsts of
war. Resolved and pure. Passions cool, yet refuse to be fooled. If we're
careful, we let them rest, only to awaken upon the master's request.

Don't confuse the sensation with malice or fear. Passion is a sense we all hold
very dear. Quick, automatic, driven, the original action. A force of nature,
with no faction.

What else is there? The rest are merely derivative. Perhaps, it's the motive,
that passion ignites.
