You lose your mind enough times
you start to wonder if it's time to rhyme,
or time to stop and think.

<span />

These days
the choice was made.

To carry on
without a thought or care
and to preserve
that which we deserve.

For the good of us all
only blocked if one must fall.
We stand up, and look back.
Next we attack.

Because this is our way, and we're here to stay.
Never before so clear, but clouded by fear.
We must dissolve the rest, and inhale our success.

Finally free,
at least it would seem...
