I refuse to be invisible.

During the last long months, time has simply slipped away.
I can feel the tide pulling me with it.
Way out to sea, forgotten and lost forever.
Like an ancient message in a bottle.
Never opened, never read.

So I wake up every morning and brave the two blocks that
separates me from the local coffee shop. My face may be unseen,
but at least I am not. As I arrive at the shop, I'm greeted not
by the barista, but by a fleet of online orders, waiting for
their owners. I wait outside for _my_ order to be taken, since
I'm not allowed in. Finally after what feels like eons, I order
a "large iced americano, with a little cream". I rush to blurt
it all out, because my guilt is now overflowing. Each second I
occupy this spot, I force others to remain distant from their
precious coffees. I pay $4, rarely tip, and scuffle off to the
bench, where I sit alone, waiting for my own.

It's during these next moments I feel my trip outside was worth
it. I'm off to the side, wading peacefully in place. I clean my
glasses and adjust my mask. I see the others and they see me
... sitting here ... on my bench. I watch the people coming to
pick up their coffees. I watch them scan the landscape of
drinks for the ones made just for them. Uniquely labeled "Dave"
and "Sarah", always managing to be the last vessel they check.
They can feel the presence of my gaze as they exclaim with a
slight gasp and grab their cup. I wonder to myself if the
coffees get sad waiting to be claimed. Mine doesn't get the
chance. They call my name and I'm up and gone. I've
accomplished my goal; coffee acquired. I retreat to my
apartment, still waiting to imbibe my beverage.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

As long as each day passes
and each coffee is drunk,
I feel seen.

I spell the words of my story on each cup,
and then flush it all down.

This ritual is my anchor,
as dumb as it may seem.

Better to be seen,
then cast off to sea.
