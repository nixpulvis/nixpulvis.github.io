I look down a well.
The cylinder fades, and the features become less proclaimed.
Each stone remains the same.

I reach for the bucket.
Tied together with care; swung grossly from it's pivot.
Simply a loose rod and some extra length.

I feel the release from gravity.
The wall begins to blur in front of me.
My hand quickly burn.

_*thud*_

I look back upon what I've seen before.
But then I notice a door.
One that hasn't been opened before.

I slowly begin to turn the knob.
Leaving well enough alone.
Bracing once again, for the unknown.
