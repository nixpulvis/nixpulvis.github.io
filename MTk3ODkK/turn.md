One day I'll change,
Just wait and see.

A new day
A new start.

Like a beautiful piece of art.

For now I lie
Simply by design.

The darkness insists
and I resist.

It's tempting tho
So that's where I go.

Down to the bottom.
In to the muck.

Who gives a flying fuck.

It fills every pore
and then some more.

I search and I wonder
but I can't stop to ponder.

Life isn't pristine
It's just a romantic scene.

Set upon our glistening eyes
like a perfect disguise.

Wake up,
Find a new song.

This revolution only lasts
for so long.

We will be,
all that they can see.

A new day
A new start.

Truly complete, to every last part.
