# nixpulvis.com

This is my personal, and semi-professional website. Created using Jekyll, and
hosted on GitHub Pages (a service which I love).

## Usage

Running Jekyll requires a modern version of Ruby. See your operating system's
help for installing that.

```sh
# Only if you don't already have bundler.
gem install bundler

# Install the dependencies.
bundle install

# Start up a local webserver on port 4000 (by default).
jekyll serve
```
