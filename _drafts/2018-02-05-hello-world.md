All things start with a "Hello World".

To a programmer this means spesifically `fn main() { println!("Hello World"); }`
But in general it should represnt the minimal effort to show the workings of a
system's dependencies. For example, let's say you are tasked with playing some
music for a crowd. Before you get to actually playing the music you must perform
a "Hello World", or in terms musicians might be firmiliar, a sound check. The
sound check does nothing to prevent you from hitting the wrong note, but simply
ensures that when you do, everyone will hear it.

This post is my "Hello World" for all the future rambling I may do. If you are
reading this now, then my system's dependecies are working.
