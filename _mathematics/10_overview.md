## Overview of Mathematics

Mathematics makes use of symbols and names somewhat liberally, allowing for a
certain amount of conciseness and expressiveness, but not always
disambiguation. Notion can be context sensitive, be careful.

Also, this is **not** a guide, or a lesson. I'm mostly trying to catalog useful
notation and expressions.

# Logic

Logic is the foundation of all reasoning and thought. Though, not all logics
are created equal.

Formal logic denotes a collection of symbols and rules for these symbols. Used
carefully, one can start here and build whole models of mathematics and thus
anything.

### Symbols

##### Negation: $$\neg A$$, $$!A$$
"Not" is written as $$\neg$$ (or $$!$$ by programmers). For example, all roads
do **not** lead to Rome. Let's call this proposition $$\neg R$$.

##### Equivalence: $$A \equiv B$$, $$A \leftrightarrow B$$
We could say that all roads _do_ in fact lead to Rome, and that would be $$\neg
\neg R \equiv R$$. This could also be written as $$\neg \neg R \leftrightarrow
R$$ (or even $$\neg \neg R \sim R$$ in Kleene's "Mathematical Logic").

##### Junction: $$A \land B$$, $$A \lor B$$
"And" and "Or" are written as $$\land$$, and $$\lor$$, respectively. We
obviously can't claim $$R \land \neg R$$ is true.

##### Implication: $$A \Rightarrow B$$, $$A \rightarrow B$$
_(also $$A \supset B$$ in Kleene's "Mathematical Logic")_

##### Existentialization: $$\exists A$$
##### Universilization: $$\forall A$$

##### Proof: $$\vdash A$$
##### Entailment: $$\vDash A$$
We can now formally state in our observer language that $$\nvDash R \land \neg
R$$, for example.

##### Approximation: $$\sim A$$, $$\approx A$$, $$O$$
Somewhere along the way to Rome I might ask, "How long has it been since we
left camp?", which, unless someone or something was perfectly counting, could
only be met with $$\sim 12$$ hours. It might also be useful to write $$t
\approx 12$$. Looking over at the travelers along side us, we recognize a few
from hours ago when we left. We could say our distance ($$d_1$$) and their
distance ($$d_2$$) are related as $$d_1(t) \sim d_2(x)$$, or even $$O(d_1(t)) =
O(d_2(t))$$.


# Mathematics

We use $$=$$ to express, for example that in $$a = a$$, $$a$$ is identical.

## Numbers

Numbers are the primary objects of math. You can use numbers to count, for
example, $$1, 2, 3$$, Go! You can use numbers for measures of units, for
example, the current temperature $$65Â°F$$.

Fractions are for frogs, $$\frac{3}{7}$$, ribbit.

## Expressions

Math is full of various operations you can write into valid (or invalid)
mathematical notation. Values can be computed, like $$\pi^3$$, or $$\sqrt[3]
2$$.

## Equations

All hail the mighty equal sign, $$=$$. Simply put, the equal sign relates two
different forms to the same underlying truth. We call this an equation.

A really obvious equation might be $$2 + 2 = 4$$, while we can represent
something as complex as the concept of a limit as simply as $$1 =
0.9999999\dots$$ or $$1 = 0.\overline{999}$$.

### Variables

Many equations have letters in them, which can allow a fixed value to change
with the variable, for example $$x^2$$ grows quickly, but $$2^x$$ even faster.
Some variables are used to represent physical, or conceptual properties, for
example $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ describes the edge lengths of a triangle, where
$$a$$ and $$b$$ and the sides, and $$c$$ is the hypotenuse.

$$
k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
$$

## Summation and Product Notation

$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1)
$$

$$
\prod_{i=a}^{b} f(i)
$$

## Vectors and Matrices

$$
\vec{o} = [1, 2, -1]
$$

$$
A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Combinatorics

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

## Limits

A $$\lim_{x\to\infty}$$ is a way to talk about the convergence of something.

$$
\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)
$$

## Derivatives

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
   = h^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
      + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
      + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} \right)
$$

## Integration

Integral $$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx$$ inside text looks nice too.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).
$$

## Cases

This is where things can get "fun".

$$
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
  \end{cases}
$$
