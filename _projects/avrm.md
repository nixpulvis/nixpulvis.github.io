I write a decent bit of code for AVRs, those tiny little processors that power
the Arduino platform. As I was learning I found I wanted less and less of the
functionality of Arduino itself, and could trade the substancial overhead for
a minimal library I've named AVRM. This library now powers a few other firmware
libraries I've written over the years.
