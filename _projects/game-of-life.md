Conway's Game of Life is a cult classic amungst programmers. It's a beautiful
algorithm to watch, yet is defined by very simple rules. There are a few
interesting design decisions that must be made by any functioning display of
the game. Here I've implemented life on a 32x32 LED grid, powered by a (ARM)
Teensy 3.1.
