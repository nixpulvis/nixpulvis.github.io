Nothing quite starts a terminal session like `fortune`. It gives you a nice
little quip to poder as you settle into your groove. The database is filled
with a bunch of philosophy and jokes. I've been using it in my `config.fish`
(akin to `.bashrc`) for years now.

But, `fortune` could be so much better. Mainly it's the perfect tool for
collecting my personal database of quotes, or random thoughts. It's actually
really easy to make your own fortunes. First create a directory with a name
indicative of your collection of quips.

```sh
mkdir personal
```

Then create a text file inside the directory with all your quips inside.

```sh
touch personal/2018
```

The format of this file is simple. Each entry is followed by a `%` on it's own
line. For example:

```
A bear is a lot to bear.
%
I've never met a bare bear.
```

Finnaly you need to turn your text file into a `.dat` file according to the
`strfile` format.

```sh
strfile personal/2018
```

Now fortune can process your own fortunes.

TODO: Updated `foretune` syntax.
