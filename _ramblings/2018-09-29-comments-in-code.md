title: Comments in Code
---

I've had many discussions and heated debates about the use of comments in code.
The conversation is usually geared toward looking for a _rule_. One side
argues, "Never write comments, code should be self documenting", while I've
seen the other side go as far as to say, "Every block of code needs a comment".

Fact is, your code should read well. This might mean writting more comments
than you want to, or it could mean creating a new function with a descriptive
name. If you **must** have a rule, here it is. Someone should be able to read
your code (from top to bottom) and understand what is going on, hopefully
getting a taste of _why_.
