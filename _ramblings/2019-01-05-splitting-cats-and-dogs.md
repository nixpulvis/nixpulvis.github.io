title: Splitting Cats and Dogs

Often when you're programming you find the need to split things up a bit. This
is such a fundamental part of programming that almost every language gives you
many tools to aid with this. Maybe it's _modules_, _classes_, _impls_, or
even _packages_. The list goes on... In fact, one of the best forms of
splitting can be a simple _function_. Even _comments_ can play a role in this
if you'd like.

There's a number of reasons you'd want to split up some part of a program. You
might be looking at a class with the need for countless functions. Instead of
defining them all one after another, it makes sense to _group_ the functions
and move them somewhere so it's clear how they are related. Or, you might be
looking to _share_ some logic across a few classes. This is key to writing
good software, since maintaining two versions of the same thing is cumbersome.
Remember, stay DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### Grouping

Grouping shouldn't require too much thought, aside from a cohesive **name** for
the way in which the functions belong together. It can often be all to easy to
end up with needless wrapper classes, or other added machinery. Another good
acronym to keep around is, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

Consider an example:

```ruby
class Dog
  def bark
    # ...
  end

  def growl
    # ...
  end

  def eat
    # ...
  end

  def drink
    # ...
  end

  def poop
    # ...
  end

  def pee
    # ...
  end
end
```

I think it's pretty clear here what functions should be grouped with each other
(this isn't always so clear), and all we need to do is split them up in some
way.  Methods like `bark` and `growl` are clearly concerned with dog
communications, while methods like `eat` and `poop` are concerned with the
sustaining life at the most basic level.

Here's a couple options:

```ruby
class Dog
  # Communicative Methods #
  #########################

  def bark
    # ...
  end

  def growl
    # ...
  end

  # Consumptive Methods #
  ######################

  def eat
    # ...
  end

  def drink
    # ...
  end

  def poop
    # ...
  end

  def pee
    # ...
  end
end

# Or, even better in my book.

class Dog
  module Communicative
    def bark
      # ...
    end

    def growl
      # ...
    end
  end

  module Consumptive
    def eat
      # ...
    end

    def drink
      # ...
    end

    def poop
      # ...
    end

    def pee
      # ...
    end
  end

  include Communicative
  include Consumptive
end
```

People often view a `module` as a way to share functionality, but here we're
just using it to group similar functions. The main thing we've done is make it
clear which functions are related, and therefore **a good idea to read
together**.  If you want to share some part of your program's design, then
you'll need to think more, though a `module` may still be the solution.

### Sharing

Sharing is about **abstraction**. It's about defining an interface, and letting
users rely on it. Sharing code lets you keep things DRY and maintainable, and
also helps keep testing focused.

Let's consider what happens when we want to add a new `Cat` class to our
program. The first thing we should notice is that we can share all of the
`Consumptive` functionality, since just like dogs, cats also eat, drink, and the
rest.

Here's a complete implementation of the `Consumptive` module we'll share:

```ruby
module Consumptive
  def initialize
    @stomach = []
    super
  end

  def eat(food)
    @stomach << { food: food }
  end

  def drink(drink)
    @stomach << { drink: drink }
  end

  def poop
    digest_to_completion(:food, "can't poop")
  end

  def pee
    digest_to_completion(:drink, "can't pee")
  end

  private

  def digest_to_completion(kind, error_message)
    victuals = @stomach.select { |v| v[kind] }

    if victuals.empty?
      raise error_message
    end

    @stomach = @stomach - victuals
  end
end
```

Notice how we've made use of a Ruby instance variable here. It's a really good
idea to keep the use of these as close to each other as possible. It's very
hard to reason about a module that's touching another module's state. Keep
spooky action at a distance out of our programs!

Some languages even make it impossible to inspect the state of another object's
guts (`@stomach` if you will), this can be a very good property. Ruby is a
little more liberal, requiring you to be more disciplined. With great power
comes great responsibility.

Well, now that everything is wrapped up nicely inside this module, all we have
to do is include it. This looks just like it did when we used a `module` for
grouping before. The only difference is that the `Consumptive` module now must
be visible to both the `Cat` and `Dog` classes.

```ruby
class Dog
  include Consumptive

  # ...
end

class Cat
  include Consumptive
end
```

### Testing

With all this in mind, let's see how we test the `Dog` class and the
`Consumptive` module. Each should only test the parts they are concerned with
directly.

First, since all of this code should run, let's `require` Ruby's testing
framework.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
```

Next, we can define the `Dog` spesific tests. These are free to do anything
they'd like with the dog, but shouldn't test `Consumptive` since that's defined
elsewhere.

```ruby
class TestDog < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @dog = Dog.new
  end

  # Implemention needed, since we left it as "# ...".
  def test_bark
    assert_equal @dog.bark, 'Woof'
  end

  # Tests ommited...
end
```

Finally, we can test the `Consumptive` module. We want to test this
functionality without relying on our `Dog` or `Cat` since they aren't the
concern of this module. A dummy class can be created just for our test, making
it very clear what's going on.

```ruby
class TestConsumptive < Minitest::Test
  class TestAnimal
    include Consumptive
    attr_reader :stomach
  end

  def setup
    @animal = TestAnimal.new
  end

  def test_eat
    assert_empty @animal.stomach
    @animal.eat("pepper")
    refute_empty @animal.stomach
  end

  def test_drink
    assert_empty @animal.stomach
    @animal.drink("slurppy")
    refute_empty @animal.stomach
  end

  def test_poop
    @animal.eat("sand")
    refute_empty @animal.stomach
    @animal.poop
    assert_empty @animal.stomach
  end

  def test_pee
    @animal.drink("soda")
    refute_empty @animal.stomach
    @animal.pee
    assert_empty @animal.stomach
  end
end
```

These tests don't cover enough cases, but you get the idea. We seem to have
a functioning set of animals on our hands!

### Naming Conventions

OK, so depending on who you ask we may have broken some rules here... First of
all, people may be expecting to see a `module` in it's own file. Well that one
is easy to fix, just move it there... though remember to preserve it's
namespace. For example, `Dog::Communicative` could be relocated to
`dog/communicative.rb` as:

```ruby
class Dog
  module Communicative
    # ...
  end
end
```

Another convention is to name your concerns (`modules`) as something-able. This
is a great huristic, but may not always be reasonable. I've intentionally
broken this pattern here. Keep in mind, not everyone is as passionate as _you_
about finding the perfect name, and while the better job we do at naming the
easier it will be to read, it's never going to be perfect.

Just try to remember this:

- A `class` is a **noun**
- A `module` is an **adjective**
- A `method` is a **verb**

Hopefully in the process of thinking through how to split up your programs
you'll discover elegant abstractions, and clean implementations. Or at least as
clean as a bunch of functions that deal with `poop` can ever be.
