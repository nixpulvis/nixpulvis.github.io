Ask anyone who knows me what browser I use (yes even on mobile).

I remember back in Middle School, we first got the pretty orange flaming fox in
the library, and it made everything better. I can't even remember why (this was
a while ago).

Fast forward to College. While I was taking Northeastern University's PL course
in Racket, I was learning Rust on the side. The next year I implemented all my
course projects in Rust, and even read some papers about things like Afine Type
Systems (I'm excited about Oxide). Now, I write Rust on the side, either for
fun [personal][oursh] [projects][brainfuck], or for [Alacritty][alacritty], a
very cool terminal emulator.

I've been following Rust developments on GitHub for years now. In addition to
the language itself (an amazing feat), I hold `cargo` in especially high
esteem. It's no small task building source code on various systems, with
dependencies coming in from anywhere. But it's crucial, because fundamentally,
code is only worth anything if it's able to run. Rust is in a somewhat
interesting position of having both "low level" systems programming, and an
aspiring wasm ecosystem, I'm interested to see how `cargo` can best facilitate
everything.

As a Rubyist, I whole-heartedly believe programming languages and their tools
should be optimized for the programmer. I've also seen first hand how much
confusion and frustration these build tools, like NPM for example, can cause in
the wild. I'm glad the Rust community takes more care in the design of these
tools. This isn't to say I'm not looking forward to NPM being improved, it's
currently the best tool available (do people still use `yarn`?), and deeply
needed.

Last, I'll mention my express interest in embedded Rust. I know there's been a
decent bit of work already put into tools like `xargo`, and I haven't played
with enough of it all yet, honestly.

But... If one day I could migrate my [avrm](https://github.com/nixpulvis/avrm)
firmware tinkerings over to Rust and run `cargo flash clock --port
/dev/ttyUSB0` I'd be sooo happy.
