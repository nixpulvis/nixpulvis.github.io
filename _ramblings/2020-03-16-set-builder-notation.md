I'm not a fan of set builder notation, and let me explain why...

I mean, it beats a lot of other things mathematicians were probably doing
before they agreed to it, but that could be said about pretty much anything.
Just look at how many people love writing Python, and how god awful that
language is. I'd expect a bit more from math notation, but I digress.

We can read a set $$\{\ e : x \in \mathbb{D}\ \}$$ as "$$\ e$$ such that $$x$$
is in $$\mathbb{D}\, $$". Here $$e$$ is an expression which has $$x$$ bound
within it.

To fully explain my position, let's start by looking at a good use of set
builder notation.

$$
A = \{\ 2x^2 : x \in \mathbb{R} \ \} \\
$$

Here we lead with the interesting stuff, being the $$2x^2$$, and brush the fact
that $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$ under the rug. This is more or less OK, because you
don't need to be thinking about what kind of number $$x$$ is to understand
the equation in this case. It's purely a formality, which may be necessary to
a larger context.

However, things start getting interesting quickly.

$$
\{\ \sqrt{x} - 2 : x ∈ [1,10) \ \}
$$

Suddenly the domain of the set and $$x$$ aren't necessarily the same, yet we
would probably assume something reasonable, right? These must all be $$\in
\mathbb{R}$$, or something. Still we've tried to lead with what we care about,
the $$\sqrt{x} - 2$$ in this case. But suddenly the right side matters a lot
more.

Next, we start calling functions on the right side.

$$
\{\ \sqrt[3]{x} : x \in filter([0, ∞), odd?) \ \}
$$

I like to think someone would stop at this point and restructure the equations.
Why am I operating on $$x$$ in $$\sqrt[3]{x}$$ before I even know what $$x$$
is?! A quick glance, and you don't even notice it anymore, it's lost in the
noise on the right.

Finally, we come to what Python starts letting you do with their surprisingly
beloved _array comprehensions_, which are basically just set builder notation
in ASCII. In math, at least we can argue about the evaluation order a little
bit, but in Python this is just downright wrong!

```python
[bar(x) for x in foo(x)]
```

The function `foo` will execute before the function `bar`, and this is not
entirely clear by reading the source. In fact, this makes me wonder what other
things in Python evaluate backwards...

One more thing, what about **chained** array comprehensions?

```python
[int(b) for x in range(0, 10) for b in bin(x)[2:]]
```

My head hurts looking at this code. Where is `x` bound? Where is `b` bound?
It's all so unclear, it really makes my wonder how Python is so popular... But
then I remember JavaScript, and it all makes a little more sense.

Meanwhile, in Rust things are done properly. We also have something like a
"such that" which is the `where` clause, however you still must at least
introduce the name up front. For example:

```rust
fn foo<A>(..., a: A, ...) where A: ...
```

This solves the problem of name resolution while I try and read this function.
Since there's always a namespace you're operating within, I must have a way to
know if `A` is local, or coming in from elsewhere. Without the leading `<A>`
I'd be left wondering what `a: A` means for far too long.
