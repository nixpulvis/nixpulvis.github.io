title: COVID-19 Pandemic
layout: rambling

I've been sheltering in place now for nearly two weeks, which was probably not
as soon as it should have been, but better late than never. In these times I've
been reading a firehose of information about this novel [COVID-19 🤒, caused by
SARS-CoV-2 🦠][naming], and it has been difficult to digest it all. Hopefully
this will serve as an accurate snapshot of the situation; at least to the best
of my understanding.

### What I Know

- This is **real**, and **serious**, many people have and will get sick, and
  some will die [[1]][cdc-cases]
- It **is not** the flu, both in effect and contagiousness
- We're going to be dealing with this, and it's ramifications for years
- I'm mostly stuck at home for now, going out only for isolated walks, and food
- We need better leadership

### What I _Think_ I Know

- I'll could be practicing "social distancing" for upwards of a year
  [[2]][vox-social-distancing]
- The test is uncomfortable, but isn't so bad [[3]][nose-test]
- Face masks aren't as effective as they might seem [[4]][face-masks]
  - Healthcare workers are in much greater need than we are [[5]][getusppe]
  - ~~They are mostly useful if you're coughing or sneezing, in which case you
    shouldn't be outside anyway~~
  - Guidelines now say to wear a facemask of some kind (I'm
    using ~~a bandana~~ 1/3 N95 masks that my Mom sent me ❤) whenever you go out
- It's spread via surface contact, droplets and the air [[6]][transmission]
  - Higher probability of infection from contact with a droplet than loose
    airborne particles
  - Can stay alive on surfaces for a few days, depending on the material
- We are likely entering an economic recession [[7]][recession]
- The United States (where I live) is doing a piss poor job
  - We should be testing random samples of the population, since many infected
    are asymptomatic
  - Laid off workers should be ensured relief until (and at least briefly
    after) "shelter in place" has ended
  - Small businesses, and farms should be supported by the Fed
  - Trump needs to **shut the fuck up**
    
    Never before in the history of our nation have we had to litterally cut the
    words of the President off the media to protect the public; it's
    unimaginable.

### What I Don't Know

- How long you stay immune after recovering from the virus
- How long until a vaccine will become readily available
- How long this pandemic will last, though it's clearly longer if we don't
  heed the warnings [[8]][kinsa-thermometer]
- How many businesses will close
- How many people will lose their jobs
- Who, that I know, will die

I'm trying to stay somewhat positive, and productive. However, the struggle is
real. In the weeks and months to come, I look forward to new creative outlets,
and a new perspective on my place here on Earth, together with you all.

Be smart out there ❤
