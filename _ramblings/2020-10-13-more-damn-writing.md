I realize I've been in a bit of a writers block as of late. I think part of the
problem can be addressed by simply writing more at all costs. What this means
exactly, on a day to day basis, I can't be sure yet. If anything this dumb rant
is a step in the right direction. I can't be paralyzed by fear, or overly
concerned with others cares.

I have too many things in motion, and not enough motivation to see them all
through at once. I must be selective, and act like a horse with blinders on.
Even if I don't make good progress, still it's better to have tried and failed,
than to have never tried at all.

It's after midnight, and I haven't been sleeping well for the last few months.
Perhaps this is also part of my problem...

Good night  
My dearest reader
