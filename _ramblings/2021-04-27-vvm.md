title: Visual Voicemail from Ruby

_Note: This post is specific to AT&T, but may be similar across other providers._

I have a [PinePhone][pine-phone] I've been trying out running
[postmarketOS][postmarket-os] recently. It's got a number of problems, but
without getting caught up listing them all, I'll talk briefly about visual
voicemail (VVM).

Yesterday I received the following SMS text message (redacted for privacy):

```
MBOXUPDATE?-m=1;server=vvm.mobile.att.net;port=143;-name=4:XXXXXXXXXX:A:XXXXX:ms-01:NAT:XXXXX
```

Neat! But what is behind `vvm.mobile.att.net`? After a quick search online and
a few threads listing some kind of status message, I decided to text back the
string `STATUS`, and sure enough it responded with the following
(formatted/elided for clarity):

```
//-
VVM:STATUS:
  ...
  srv=2:vvm.mobile.att.net;
  ...
  smtp_u=4:XXXXXXXXXX:A:XXXXX:ms01:NAT:XXXXX;
  smpt_pw=XXXXXXX;
  ...
```

OK, I could have probably remembered what my pin was, but now we know this
thing is using SMTP to send messages. This should make it relatively easy to
download the voicemail with IMAP.

At this point, you could probably plug in the username and password (pin) to
your favorite email client of choice, but I want to write a small script to
retrieve these for me as audio files directly. So, it's off to Ruby's STD
[`net/imap`][net/imap] library to try and fetch the voicemail(s).

```ruby
require 'net/imap'

# Authenticate with the remote IMAP server.
#
# Fetches must be done within a relatively short time window
# after this request completes.
def imap_login(phone_number, pin, host: 'vvm.mobile.att.net', port: 143)
  imap = Net::IMAP.new(host, port: port)
  imap.login(phone_number, pin)
  imap
end

# Print all the mailboxes in the authenticated IMAP server.
def fetch_mailboxes(imap)
  imap.list("", "*").each do |mailbox|
    puts mailbox.name
  end
end

# Print the messages in an authenticated IMAP server's mailbox.
def fetch_mailbox(imap, mailbox)
  imap.examine(mailbox)
  imap.fetch(1..-1, ["ENVELOPE"]).each do |message|
    envelope = message.attr["ENVELOPE"]
    puts "[#{message.seqno}] #{envelope.date}\t#{envelope.from[0].name}"
  end
end
```

Create an `imap` variable for interacting with the server:

```ruby
imap = imap_login('XXXXXXXXXX', 'XXXXXXX')
```

By calling `fetch_mailboxes(imap)` I can tell there's a mailbox conveniently
named `INBOX`, along with `Trash`, and `Greetings`, something I can only assume
holds the voicemail message I recorded a while ago.

So, sure enough calling `fetch_mailbox(imap, "INBOX")` lists all five
voicemails in my inbox, along with the `seqno`, date and sender's phone number.

```

```

Great, now all I need to do is decode the body of the messages and play it from
my speakers. To do this, first we fetch both the `BODYSTRUCTURE` and `BODY`
sections, which contain the metadata and contents of the voicemail audio. I'm
assuming that there will always only be a since part to this structure, so we
also directly request the first body message with `BODY[1]`. By looking at the
full metadata in the body structure's response I know that this message is
base64 encoded, so a quick `decode64` call we can write the file to disk.

```ruby
require 'base64'

def fetch_mailbox_message(imap, mailbox, seqno)
  imap.examine(mailbox)
  imap.fetch(seqno, ["BODY", "BODY[1]"]).map do |message|
    part_body = Base64.decode64(message.attr["BODY[1]"])
    File.open('voice.amr', "w") do |file|
      file.write(part_body)
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, just call `fetch_mailbox_message(imap, "INBOX", seqno)` and we can
play the message with `vlc voice.amr` or whatever else you have that knows what
an AMR file is (I sure don't).

Hopefully this helps someone else who's stuck trying to listen to their
voicemails.
