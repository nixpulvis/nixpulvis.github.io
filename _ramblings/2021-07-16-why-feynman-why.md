Feynman is famous for (incorrectly) asserting the following rebuke. This idiom,
as I've seen, has been used in select groups as the fundamental argument
against various topics of conversation:

> Don't ask **why** in science.

Unless I'm mistaken, I believe this tale originates with [this
clip](https://youtu.be/Q1lL-hXO27Q) from an interview on the [BBC TV series
'Fun to Imagine' (1983)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0198zc1).

**He never actually says don't ask why**, he simply demonstrates the rabbit
hole you enter when you start asking these questions. In fact, he makes a point
to directly address this topic and you can see how happy he is just thinking
about the concept.

So where's the problem with why coming from? I suspect it's the following
quote, which was the only enlarged and repeated quote in the whole [fs
blog post (2012)](https://fs.blog/2012/01/richard-feynman-on-why-questions).

This I believe to be the real quote... but, just for fun, let's consider how to
interpret the original statement anyway; as if he had said it.

Feynman wouldn't be saying, one must **never** ask why, rather he's implicitly
challenging you to ask why of the statement itself. In doing so, it forces a
deeper understanding of questions, which are the requisite precursors to the
juicy answers we all crave.

Take the question he *did* ask, "how does a person answer why something
happens". Well, you simply dive deeper into the matrix, down that rabbit hole
and into the void. This can be tantalizing and wildly rewarding. It can also be
a massive waste of time; thus the divergent interpretations.

So anyway, if someone comes along giving you shit about "why" questions and you
need an out, just say "how come?". These are "how" people, for whatever reason.
