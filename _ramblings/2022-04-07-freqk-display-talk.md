I got the opportunity to show off this project a bit during an impromptu
tech talk slot at my current company. I kinda winged it, but it mostly came out
good. I was freaking out a bit the night before until I realized I had a tripod
in the closet. At one point I had a webcam strapped to my forehead... horrible.

Anyway, enjoy the show:
