- `fn` type returns from `obliv if`
    - Wrapped in new closure which calls an `obliv if` inside when called:
```rust
obliv if p { |a...| e1 } else { |a...| e2 }
|a...| { obliv if p { e1 } else { e2 }
```
- `panic!` within `obliv if`
    - Currently ruled out of Oxide (has `abort` instead, which cannot be rescued from)
    - The `Output` for division of obliv types should handle division by zero explicitly:
```rust
impl<T> Div for obliv T {
         type Output = Option<T>;
         fn div(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output { ... }
}
if let Some(n) = obliv 5 / obliv 0 {
        // never hit
} else {
        // handle division by zero
}
```
    - Otherwise we just state that `x/0 == 0`. This will cause user who care about the value `0/x` being distinct to do their own checking
    - obliv-c for example, just crashes when you divide by 0
- Obliv compound types (i.e. `obliv Option<T>` or `obliv (T, U)`), what about `Cell<T>`
    - The idea of an `obliv enum` in general is interesting (along with `obliv match`)
    - `obliv (T, U)` oblivious tuple, not to be confused with a plain tuple of oblivious types, `(obliv T, obliv U)` is tricky because tuples are heterogeneous
    - `obliv [T; n]`
    - Oxide doesn't have a notion of `Cell`, or interior mutability in general
- `obliv fn` ideally shouldn't be needed (need `frz` qualifier?)
    - In obliv-c it exists to limit mutation from the outside, whereas we should be reasoning about the mutability of arguments in a closure
    - `static mut` items (which are unsafe) allow security leaks if allowed in `obliv` contexts:
```rust
static mut X: u32 = 0;
// f is *not* obliv safe.
fn f() {
        unsafe {
            X = 2;
        }
}
```
- 2 stage borrow's `reserved` is similar to `freeze`
    - [Currently `&'a mut T` could really be viewed as `RefMut<'r, 'w, T>` with
      explicit lifetimes for reading and writing.](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2017/03/01/nested-method-calls-via-two-phase-borrowing)
