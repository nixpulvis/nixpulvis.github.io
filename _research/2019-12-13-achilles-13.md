### Party Perspectives `@P { ... }`

When writing classic local programs (e.g. Rust 2018) all bindings have affinity
to the only local party, you (or `@me`). To bridge the gap into the MPC
context, we allow `global!` blocks `@P { e }` to only evaluate into `Some(e)`
if the party running the block locally is `@P`.

```rust
// Ideal syntax?
let r: i32@A = @A { rand() };

// Macro syntax? Closer to what exists today.
let r: Option<i32> = global!(@A, rand());
```

This composes with `conceal` which can accept an `Option<T>` from a party.

```rust
let s: Obliv<i32> = conceal!(@P <= @A, r);
```

`conceal!` also gives shorthand for creating and consuming the `Option` at
once.

```rust
let s: Obliv<i32> = conceal!(@P <= @A { rand() });
```

The following would fail to type check, since `r` is only `Some` for `@A`, but
we're saying here that `@B` is providing this value. This implies that
`Option<i32>` really isn't going to work, we need `i32@P`, which acts like an
optional.

```rust
let s: Obliv<i32> = conceal!(@P <= @B, r);
```

To participate in a protocol where we do not know the block which the other
party is executing, we can use `concealed!(@P <= @B)`, which is shorthand for
`conceal!(@P <= @B, None)`.

```rust
let s: Obliv<i32> = concealed!(@P <= @B);
```

This allows `@A` and `@B` to write partially separated code. For example below,
`@A` calls `rand` for `s`, and `@B` calls `prompt` (perhaps reading from STDIN)
for `t`, without each other knowing about how these binding's values were
generated.

```rust
// @A's code:
let s = conceal!(@P <= @A { rand() });
let t = concealed!(@P <= @B);

// @B's code:
let s = concealed!(@P <= @A);
let t = conceal!(@P <= @B { prompt() });
```

Which could be rewritten to expose the `rand` and `read` calls globally as a
single source program once more.

```rust
let s = conceal!(@P <= @A { rand() });
let t = conceal!(@P <= @B { prompt() });
```

Finally, we want to `reveal` some information from `@P` to another party `@A`.

```rust
let o: i32@A = reveal!(@P => @A, s + t);
```

### Special `@me` Party

TODO: More thought needs to be given to where `@P` should show up in this
example below. I'm starting to wonder if it's something that belongs on the
reference, related to the lifetimes.

```rust
fn is_mine<@P, 'a, T>(x: &'a T @P) -> bool {
    if @P == @me {
        true
    } else {
        false
    }
}

// Always true.
let x = 1;
assert!(is_mine(&x));

// Fails for `@B`.
let x = @A { 1 };
assert!(is_mine(&x));
```

### Example `invertPerm` Function

```rust
// TODO: Purpose statements for the three helper functions.
fn randomPermutation() -> Vec<usize>;
fn waksmanBits(v: Vec<usize>) -> Vec<usize>;
fn waksmanPerm(v: Vec<Obliv<usize>>, w: Vec<Obliv<usize>>)
    -> Vec<Obliv<usize>>;

fn invertPerm<@P, @A, @B>(x: Vec<Obliv<usize>>)
    -> Vec<Obliv<usize>>
    where @P: @A + @B
{
    let (pa, pa_waksman) = conceal!(@P <= @A {
        let lpa: Vec<usize> = randomPermutation();
        let lpa_waksman: Vec<usize> = waksmansBits(&lpa);
        (lpa, lpa_waksman)
    });

    let pb: Vec<Obliv<usize>> = waksmanPerm(&x, &pa_waksman);
    let pb_local: Vec<usize@B> = reveal_map!(pb, @P => @B);

    let pbinv_waksman = conceal!(@P <= @B {
        let pbinv: Vec<usize> = invertPermutation(&pb_local);
        waksmanBits(&pbinv)
    });

    waksmanPerm(&pa, &pbinv_waksman)
}
```
