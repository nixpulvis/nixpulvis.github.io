Time passes from _event_ to event before _resolution_.

```
(... e1 e2)
```

$$
\epsilon_1 \cdots \epsilon_2
$$

A _promise_ always resolves itself.

```
(... (. e) e)
```

$$
\cdot\epsilon \ \cdots \ \epsilon
$$

A _try_ can _fail_.

```
(... (\ e) (e | f))
```

$$
\dot\epsilon \ \cdots \ \epsilon \ | \ \lambda
$$

A _wish_ might resolve.

```
(... (e .) (| e))
```

$$
\epsilon\cdot \ \cdots \ | \ \epsilon
$$

A _lie_ always fails if resolved.

```
(... (e \) (| f))
```

$$
\underset{\cdot}{\epsilon} \ \cdots \ | \ \lambda
$$

I try to wish to $$\epsilon$$.

$$
\dot\epsilon \ \cdots \ \cdot \ | \ \lambda
$$

I wish to try to $$\epsilon$$.

$$
\dot\epsilon\cdot \ \cdots
$$

I try then lie about $$\epsilon$$.

$$
\dot\epsilon \ \cdots \ \underset{\cdot}{\epsilon}
$$

I try $$\epsilon_1$$ then lie about $$\epsilon_2$$.

$$
\dot\epsilon_1 \ \cdots \ \underset{\cdot}{\epsilon_2}
$$

I promise to lie to try to wish for $$\epsilon$$.

$$
\cdot\underset{\cdot}{\dot\epsilon}\cdot
$$

### Notes

- $$\cdot$$ kinda fits with _context_ in "I try to wish".
- Duplicate actions are tricky to write (e.g. "I try to try").
- Precedence is a mess.
- Must time pass between verbs?
