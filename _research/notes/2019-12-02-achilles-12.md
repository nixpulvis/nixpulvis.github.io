### Protocol Topology Notation

#### Fully Connected Graphs

Sets of fully connected parties are denoted with `{}`, for example the
following shows a simple network of four parties:

```graph
P = { A, B, C, D }
```

We can nest sets within each other:

```graph
P = { { A, B }, { C, D } }
```

The two examples above are equivalent, however it may be useful to label
specific groups of nodes anyway.

```graph
Q = { A, B }
R = { C, D }
P = { Q, R }
```

#### Fully Disconnected Graphs

We can also define fully disconnected graphs with `[]`.

```graph
P = [A, B, C, D]
```

While a disconnected graph may seem useless by itself, when nested within a
larger connected graph they allow us to represent arbitrarily complex
topologies of graphs (TODO: is this actually true?).

#### Star Graphs

For example a "star" network with four edge nodes and a single center node can
be represented like this:

![](/img/research/achilles/star-graph.png)

```graph
P = { S, [A, B, C, D] }
  = [{ S, A }, { S, B }, { S, C }, { S, D }]
```

Or a more complex example of a "server star" graph.

```graph
I = [I1, I2, I3, I4, I5]
S = {S1, S3, S3}
O = [O1, O2, O3, O4]
P = {S, [I, O]}
```

#### Example Reduction

Here we show that starting with a graph description `P`, we end up with an
equivalent graph description `P'` through a series of reductions.

`P` is a graph of a disconnected `[A,B]`, connected to `C`, all disconnected
from `D`, finally connected to `E`. We can interpret this more naturally by
thinking of the fully connected graph `{A,B,C,D,E}`, then removing connections
to maintain the property that `[A,B]` and `[D, {A,B,C}]` are disconnected.

```graph
P  = {[{[A,B],C},D],E}
   ->
     {[[{A,C},{B,C}],D],E}
   ->
     {[{A,C},{B,C},D],E}
   ->
P' = [{A,C,E},{B,C,E},{D,E}]
```
