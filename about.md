I'm a *hacker*, meaning I prefer an unlocked door. I'm also a *tinker*, by a
more literal definition -- I like to dirty my hands building things. I have a
passion for programming languages and embedded systems. You'll likely find me
writing Rust, soldering something, or trying to play my keyboards.

Iâ€™m originally from Colorado and moved to Boston to attend Northeastern University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Science.Afterwards, I moved to Silicon Valley to work for Apple's iPhone Hardware team;
grew displeased with Apple and the Bay Area and moved back to Boston to return school and find inspiration and purpose once more.
