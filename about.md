I'm a *hacker*, meaning I prefer an unlocked door. I'm also a *tinker*, by a
more literal definition -- I like to dirty my hands building things. I have a
passion for programming languages and embedded systems. You'll likely find me
writing Rust, soldering something, or trying to play my keyboards.

I’m originally from Colorado and moved to Boston to attend Northeastern University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Science. Afterwards, I moved to Silicon Valley to work for Apple's iPhone Hardware team;
grew displeased with Apple and the Bay Area and moved back to Boston to return to school and find inspiration and purpose once more.
