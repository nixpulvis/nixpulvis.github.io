Welcome to my slice of the internet. The pseudonym **nix** (_snow_) **pulvis**
(_powder or dust_) is more or less my online handle. If you would like to find
me elsewhere, here are some more places to look:

- <mailto:nathan@nixpulvis.com>
- [GitHub](https://github.com/nixpulvis)

I'm a *hacker*, meaning I prefer an unlocked door. I'm also a *tinker*, by a
more literal definition -- I like to dirty my hands building things. I have a
passion for programming languages and embedded systems. You'll likely find me
writing Rust, soldering something, or trying to play my keyboards.

If you would like to read more of my [rambling](/ramblings) or about a
[project](/projects) I've done, please do! I'm always excited to hear feedback
as well.

Iâ€™m originally from Colorado and moved to Boston to attend Northeastern
University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Science.
Afterwards I moved to Silicon Valley to work for Apple's iPhone Hardware team,
grew displeased with Apple and the Bay Area and moved back to Boston.

##### Incomplete List of iPhone Problems as of 2022-02-3

- [Headphone Limits](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252113205)
    - WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!
- Lack of 3.5mm audio jack
    - This deserves a longer justification, but suffice to say, music is worth
      the DAC inside my iPhone
- Camera bulge and case lip
    - I just want my phone to lie flat on a surface, is that too much to ask
      for
- Screen notch
    - This wouldn't have to be such a big problem if iOS would simple treat the
      area outside the rectangle as something like the doomed touchbar;
      completely separate from the rest of the screen
    - Nobody wants to scroll and zoom around this fucking thing
- [Contact hell](/ramblings/2021-01-14-ios-contact-hell)
    - What happened to vCards just working?
- Voice control can't be disabled?
    - In my experience, it never understands me anyway; instead it calls people
      random causing anxiety and stress
- ...
