# Who am `i`

Welcome to my sclice of the internet. If you'd like to find me elsewhere, here
are some more places to look:

- 202.701.4368
- <mailto:nathan@nixpulvis.com>
- [GitHub](https://github.com/nixpulvis)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nixpulvis)

I'm a *hacker*, meaning I like to make things (and break things). I have a
passion for Programming Languages (PL) and embedded systems. You'll likely
find me writing Rust or soldering something.

I’m from Colorado, went to school in Boston, moved to Silicon Valley, and now
I'm a ski bum back in Colorado, looking for work in Boston as early as May
2018.

I graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Computer and
Information Science. I'm planning on going back to school with a focus on PL
[soon™](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/23112/where-did-soon-originate).
