### Hello and Welcome!

```rust
// Define "nixpulvis" in Latin.
let nix = snow;
let pulvis = powder || dust;
```

Welcome to my slice of the internet. If you'd like to find me elsewhere, here

I'm a *hacker*, meaning I like to make things (and break things). I'm also a
*tinker*, by a more literal definition -- I like to get my hands dirty. I have
a passion for Programming Languages (PL) and embedded systems. You'll likely
find me writing Rust or soldering something.

If you would like to read more of my [rambling](/ramblings) or about a
[project](/projects) I've done, please do!

I’m from Colorado, went to school in Boston, moved to Silicon Valley, then back
to Colorado to be a ski bum for a bit, now I'm working at Forward Financing in
Boston.

I graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Computer and
Information Science. I'm planning on going back to school with a focus on PL
