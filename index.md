### Hello and Welcome!

```rust
// Define "nixpulvis" in Latin.
let nix = snow;
let pulvis = powder || dust;
```

Welcome to my slice of the internet. If you'd like to find me elsewhere, here
are some more places to look:

I'm a *hacker*, meaning I prefer an unlocked door. I'm also a *tinker*, by a
more literal definition -- I like to dirty my hands building things. I have a
passion for programming languages (PL) and embedded systems. You'll likely find
me writing Rust or soldering something.

If you would like to read more of my [rambling](/ramblings) or about a
[project](/projects) I've done, please do!

I’m originally from Colorado, and moved to Boston to attend Northeastern
University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Science.
Afterwards I moved to Silicon Valley to work for Apple, before falling out of
love with the coast, and Apple's ecosystem. Now I'm back at NU working on
[secure computation][seccomp] and [Rust][rust].

You can view my [resume](/resume.pdf) for more information.
