I'm a *hacker*, meaning I like to make things (and break things). I'm also a
*tinker*, by a more literal definition -- I like to get my hands dirty. I have
a passion for Programming Languages (PL) and embedded systems. You'll likely
find me writing Rust or soldering something.

If you would like to read more of my [rambling](/ramblings) or about a
[project](/projects) I've done, please do!

I’m from Colorado, went to school in Boston, moved to Silicon Valley, and now
I'm a ski bum back in Colorado, looking for work in Boston as early as May
2018.

I graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Computer and
Information Science. I'm planning on going back to school with a focus on PL
