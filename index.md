Welcome to my slice of the internet. The pseudonym **nix** (_snow_) **pulvis**
(_powder or dust_) is more or less my online handle. If you would like to find
me elsewhere, here are some more places to look:

- <mailto:nathan@nixpulvis.com>
- [GitHub](https://github.com/nixpulvis)

I'm a *hacker*, meaning I prefer an unlocked door. I'm also a *tinker*, by a
more literal definition -- I like to dirty my hands building things. I have a
passion for programming languages and embedded systems. You'll likely find me
writing Rust, soldering something, or trying to play my keyboards.

If you would like to read more of my [rambling](/ramblings) or about a
[project](/projects) I've done, please do! I'm always excited to hear feedback
as well.

Iâ€™m originally from Colorado and moved to Boston to attend Northeastern
University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer and Information Science.
Afterwards I moved to Silicon Valley to work for Apple's iPhone Hardware team.
However, I fell out of love with Apple and the west coast in general.  Now I'm
getting back into academia and [research](/research).

You can view my [resume](/resume.pdf) for more information.
